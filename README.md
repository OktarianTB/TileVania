# The Making of TileVania - Coursework

This is the repository for the game TileVania which I have made following [this](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/) course on C# & Unity game engine.

**Here's everything I've learned:**

1 - How to use tiles in unity (tilemap, rule tiles, colliders)  
2 - Cross Platform Input  
3 - Cinemachine to make the camera follow the player  
4 - Coroutines  
5 - Game Sessions
